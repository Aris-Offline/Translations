We have divided some of the communities into different topics or interests to help you find the right place to chat. Each channel has its own rules and guidelines, so please read them carefully before participating. Before you join, please make sure you are joining the right channel for your interests. 

## Division of Topics

For <u>Discord, Telegram, QQ Guild</u>, you can join with just an all-in-one link. And you can see the channel list after joining.

For <u>QQ Groups</u>, each topic has its own group, and you should join the group that matches your interests.

Fo other platforms, we haven't set up the channels yet, which means you can talk about anything in the group. However, once we set up the channels, you should follow the channel conduct.

## How It Works

Off-topic discussions and topics that don't fit other channels should be only discussed in the `General`, `Off-Topic` or `Entertainment` channels. These channels are designed for casual conversations and off-topic discussions. All non-work, non-technical, or casual chatter (e.g., jokes, hobbies, random questions) must go here as well. These stuff are strictly prohibited in other channels.

Only discuss topics directly related to the <u>channel's purpose</u>. *e.g., "Desktop Development" → desktop coding/software talk only (**Strictly technical**, and no mobile or web development, which have their own channels)*. Post in the correct channel. If unsure, ask moderators first. No unrelated discussions (e.g., memes, off-topic questions).

Product-specific channels are for <u>discussing the product only</u>, this includes feedback, asking for help, suggestions, bug reports, tips & tricks sharing, and more. *e.g., "MCSkinn" → only talk about MCSkinn, Minecraft skinning. Anything else such as memes, jokes, Minecraft gameplay, mods, or other games and products should be discussed in the appropriate channels.* Do NOT discuss a product in the wrong channel.

Posts in wrong channels will be removed or moved to the correct channel. Repeated offenses will result in a warning, mute, or ban.
