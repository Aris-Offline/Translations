As you know, some social media platforms may limit how many members you can have in a group. To ensure fair access and lively discussions in these platform-limited groups, we have set the following rules for capacity:

## Active Membership Policy

Some platforms cap group sizes. When a group nears capacity, we temporarily remove inactive or non-participating members to free space for new joiners. This policy doesn't apply to those platforms without group size limits.

We only remove members only if the group is near capacity. We do not remove members when there are still plenty of open spots for new members.

### Who Gets Removed?

Accounts inactive for too long

Members who only "lurk" (read but never engage), or who engage in ways that don't contribute to the group (e.g., spamming)

Those violating our Community Guidelines

## Removal â‰  Rejection

**You're Always Welcome Back!** If removed, simply rejoin via the original invite link when you're ready to participate. No hard feelings - we're just making room for fresh voices!

**Not a Punishment** This isn't a ban, and doesn't reflect poorly on you. Just think of it as a "reset" to keep conversations vibrant.

## No Splinter Groups

**Why?** Fragmented groups dilute community magic.

**Our Stance**: We won't create Group #2, #3, etc. Focused, active hubs > multiple dead chats.

### What Should I Do?

Try to engage more in the group if you can. Now's the time to speak up!

Add our official website to your bookmarks, leave quietly, and come back loudly when you're ready to participate.

Choose a platform with no member limits. For example, Discord and Telegram have much looser capacity restrictions than QQ does.

Go talk to the owner of the social media platform and ask them to remove the group size limit.

## TL;DR

We prioritize engaged members. Left quietly? Come back loudly! ðŸš€
