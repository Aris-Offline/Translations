## 1. Respectful Interactions

**No Spamming or Disruptive Behavior**: Avoid excessive messaging, frequent image posting, irrelevant links, inciting drama, personal attacks, toxic remarks, or harassment.

**No External Sharing**: Do not <u>screenshot or share chat logs</u> outside the community to provoke conflict or public discussion when not approved by the admins and other involved members. We are not responsible for anything members share outside the group. If you have seen anyone sharing chat logs to other groups or platforms, please report it to the admins. You will be rewarded for your help, and the person who shared the chat logs will be <u>immediately banned</u>.

**Keep Conflicts In-House**: Any <u>disputes or disagreements</u> that do not have a positive impact on our company, it's services or products, most members in the group, or the development of humanity and technology should be resolved privately. Do not involve other members or admins unless necessary. Doxxing, threatening, or blackmailing is strictly prohibited.

**Mind Your Energy**: Negativity should be respected, however, spreading it around is really not cool. Keep it to yourself. Treat everyone, including staff, <u>with respect and kindness</u>.

**Every Inch Counts**: No <u>spamming, or sending the same and meaningless messages</u> (like some stickers, etc.; also those repeaters, where one person says something and then a bunch of people follow up saying the same thing). The screen space is public and limited, it's not your home, you can't just take it. Boring spamming will only waste the time of those who are really looking for information, and make the group chaotic. Also, please do not split one message into multiple messages, this will make the group messy, please try to express the complete meaning in one message.

## 2. Content Standards

**Never Talk about State Affairs**: Avoid discussing <u>nations, politics, religion, race, sexuality, or other sensitive topics</u>. This includes sharing content that could be considered illegal or harmful. Neither praise, comment, nor criticize any nations, political, religion party, figures, events, or any other sensitive topics, as this may lead to endless trouble for you, us, and others in the group.

**Zero Tolerance for Illegal Content**: Do not share or promote <u>illegal activities</u>, including piracy, hacking, or any form of criminal behavior. You should also follow the rules of the region the <u>chat platform is based in</u>. *(For example, if the chat platform is based in the US, you should follow US laws; if the chat platform is based in CN, you should follow the Chinese laws, where some websites are not allowed to be accessed by some means.)* If your illegal content leads to legal liability, group violations, or other losses for us, we will hold you accountable in a serious manner.

**Family Safe**: Keep content <u>family-friendly</u>, avoid NSFW, explicit (such as sexual, bloody content, including but not limited to showing, implying sexual activity, related body parts, etc.), disgusting or offensive material. Violence, pornography, or hate speech is strictly prohibited. Remember that <u>kids of all ages</u> are in the group, so please <u>keep it clean</u>.

**No Plagiarism**: Do not share content that is <u>not yours without proper credit</u>. This includes copying, stealing, or claiming someone else's work as your own.

**No Watering**: If you want to send "bubble" text or similar stickers in the group from time to time, then please do not join this group, we do not welcome any watering behavior. If you want to find a place where you can water, then please create a group yourself, or join other groups that allow watering. We don't need you to "liven up the atmosphere", what we need is meaningful discussion and communication. Our community is not for you to "play around", this is a serious place, except for the chit-chat and entertainment channels.

**Language Preferences**: We may have different <u>language preferences for different chat platforms that you should always follow</u>, which are listed at the entrance of the invite link. If there is no language preference, you may use your preferred language, but please be aware that not everyone may understand it.

## 3. Trust & Authenticity

**No Impersonation**: Never pretend to be <u>official staff or representatives</u>, or do anything that could mislead others.

This also includes sharing referral links, affiliate links, or any other form of <u>self-promotion</u>. *(e.g. "Check out my new video", "Join my Discord server", "I'm selling this item", "Help me build my app", "I'm looking for someone to do this for me, I'll pay you", "I'm new here, this is my channel, please subscribe", etc.)*

**No Exploitative Behavior**: Do not <u>take advantage of the community for personal gain</u>, such as asking for free work, services, recruitment, paid services, or any other form of exploitation.
