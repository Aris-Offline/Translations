You will be rewarded for your help, and the person who shared the chat logs will be <u>immediately banned</u>.

**Keep Conflicts In-House**: Any disputes or disagreements should be resolved privately. Do not involve other members or admins unless necessary. Doxxing, threatening, or blackmailing is strictly prohibited.

You should also follow the rules of the country the chat platform is based in. *(For example, if the chat platform is based in the US, you should follow US laws; if the chat platform is based in CN, you should follow the Chinese laws, where VPNs are not allowed.)*

**Family Safe**: Keep content family-friendly, avoid NSFW, explicit, or offensive material. Violence, pornography, or hate speech is strictly prohibited. Remeber that kids might be in the group, so keep it clean.

**No Plagiarism**: Do not share content that is not yours without proper credit. This includes copying, stealing, or claiming someone else's work as your own.

## 3. Trust & Authenticity

**No Impersonation**: Never pretend to be official staff or representatives, or do anything that could mislead others.

## 4. Profit & Promotion

**No Ads or Promotions**: Unsanctioned ads, product/service recommendations, buying/selling requests, or idle trading promotions are not allowed. This also includes sharing referral links, affiliate links, or any other form of self-promotion. *(e.g. "Check out my new video", "Join my Discord server", "I'm selling this item", "Help me build my app", "I'm looking for someone to do this for me, I'll pay you", etc.)*

**No Exploitative Behavior**: Do not take advantage of the community for personal gain, such as asking for free work, services, recruitment, paid services, or any other form of exploitation.
