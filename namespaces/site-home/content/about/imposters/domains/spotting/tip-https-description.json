    "en-US": "Always check for HTTPS in the URL. If the site doesn't have a valid SSL certificate, it's a red flag - this usually means that your connection to us has been hijacked and tampered with by an attacker, and does NOT mean that the website you are visiting is a fake.. We always use HTTPS for our domains.",
