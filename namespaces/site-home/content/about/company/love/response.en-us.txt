Thank you for seeing what we see - that great products just relentless care, if there's no corporate budgets.

MCSkinn's refactor is indeed taking time because we're rebuilding its foundations (no more legacy code headaches!). Inkways' evolution is equally ambitious - we're prototyping features that'll make the current version feel like a sketchbook.

You've nailed why we exist: to build 'small-studio surprises' that punch above their weight. Stay tuned - we're just warming up, and will never forget who sent us the warmest encouragements when in the dimmest of times.

Best,
iNKORE Studios
