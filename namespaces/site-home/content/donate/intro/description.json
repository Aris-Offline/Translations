    "en-US": "No sugarcoating: We do have commercial products and paid software, however, they barely pay the rent. We are not a charity, but we are not a big company either. Our free products and open-source projects are much more popular and widely used than our paid ones, which makes us spend our time, energy, money, and resources on them many times beyond those making money.",
    "zh-CN": "不拐弯抹角：我们确实有商业产品和付费软件，但它们几乎无法支付租金。我们不是慈善机构，但我们也不是大公司。我们的免费产品和开源项目比我们的付费产品更受欢迎和广泛使用，这使我们在时间、精力、金钱和资源上投入的远远超过那些能够赚到钱的产品。"
