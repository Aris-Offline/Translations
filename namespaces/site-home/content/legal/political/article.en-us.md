At iNKORE!, we are committed to serving a global audience with respect, inclusivity, and neutrality. We recognize that certain elements on our website—such as national flags, maps, country or region names, and other geographic or cultural references—may be considered politically sensitive or subject to differing interpretations around the world.

## Neutrality and Intent

Our company maintains a strictly neutral stance on all political, territorial, and cultural matters. The inclusion of any flag, map, country or region name, or related symbol on our website is solely for the purpose of enhancing user experience and facilitating navigation. These elements do not represent or imply any political position, endorsement, or viewpoint by iNKORE!.

## About Caching and Local Devices
